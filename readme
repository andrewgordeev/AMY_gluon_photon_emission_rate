Mathematica code to compute the gluon and photon emission rate in a quark-gluon plasma, at leading order, in the AMY formalism.

Based on arXiv:hep-ph/0111107, arXiv:hep-ph/0204343, arXiv:hep-ph/0211036, arXiv:hep-ph/0309332

The photon code, "AMY_photon.nb", is well documented.  The gluon code is not documented at all.

The algorithm to solve the AMY integral kernel is extremely inefficiently implemented, but multiple people showed interest in this code over the years, and I have found it useful myself. I figure there is no harm making it public. Feel free to improve upon it.

The integral equation is solved in impact parameter space as explained in Section 3 of arXiv:hep-ph/0211036 . The solver follows the logic of Section 4 of that same paper, but follows a less efficient approach to fix the normalisation of the solution.

Many thanks to Tianyu Dai and Soeren Schlichting for validating the gluon emission code, and to Igor Kozlov and Hualong Gervais and probably other people back in my McGill days who helped debug this code and improve it in the early days.
